# odin-recipes

This is the TOP project about making website with recipes.

There is a index.html, file which is the homepage, with an iconic picture of actor Alberto Sordi eating spaghetti.

Inside the homepage there are links to 4 recipes, which can be a full course lunch (or dinner): 
- Carbonara
- Chicken
- Mashed potatoes
- Tiramis√π

Each recipe page is structured in this way:
1. Heading
2. Picture
3. Description
4. Ingredients
5. Steps
6. A link to next recipe and a link to previus recipe
7. A link to the homepage
