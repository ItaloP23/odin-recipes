                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and garlic, 
                    lower heat to medium, 
                    and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>
                    When the potatoes are almost finished, 
                    heat milk and butter in a small saucepan
                     over low heat until butter is melted.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>
                    Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Slowly add warm milk mixture, 
                    blending it in with a potato masher
                     or electric mixer until potatoes are smooth and creamy. 
                     Season with salt and pepper.
